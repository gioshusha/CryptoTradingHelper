# projectCH

This project will help visualise data and performe analysis on current data.
currently working:
    make simple line chart which will show prices from CSV file.
    add some code that will download data from csv
# projectCH 0.0.1

In this version i decided to start making more specialised version of my app.
original goal was to create little infromative app using dash.plot.ly, but i think i will be able to create something
more interesting that orignially planned.

Currently working:
    add pie chart showing supply and demand
    make above mentioned pie chart update in real time (currently they)
    make sure that line chart will take data directly from code ignoring CSV file.
    change price download file

#ProjectCh 0.0.2

In this version I added live updates on pie chart, that shows current supply and demand ratio from market.
RSS feed from investing.com ( need to change it, we only have excess to topics.)
There also is new version of line chart that displays BOLL incicator and prices in last 24h.

Currently working:
    live update on RSS
    live update of the lates price in text format.
future plans (most likely will not be added in next version of the file):
    add option to chose between cryptocurrencies.
    find better RSS feed which will give me more information that current one.
    Add your own API Key. (currently using my API Key from Code. I want to change it)
    make trading possible from the platform, without going to the original site.
#ProjectCh 0.0.3
In this version i updated both RSS links, but most importand is that i was able to addit real time text. currently with
this method i am traking price and supply and demand weighted average prices.
had to change max number of RSS Mannually in rss.py. did not understand reason for the error, because max number of rss was same for both links,
but for some reason it did not give me error with old code

Currently working:
    modifing visualisation of existing graphs and page as a whole.

Future plans did not change from last time except I would like to add analysis in the platform.
Main priority is to make sure, that i will not need to resart code in order to see updates.

#ProjectCh 0.0.4

Ok this update was faster than I expected. Main changes were mostly cosmetic:
1)I made main chart Bigger. now it takes whole page rather than some parts of it.
2)Changed background color and font color for both graphs and text.
3)Color code for supply pie chart
4)changed places for few of the data holders.

(side comment)
now i am more or less setisfied for the DEMO version of my layout. of course it will be much more complicated and more infromative in the future (I hope)
but for now it is as good as it will get. I prefer to work for future modifications of the file making it more usufull before i start to modify layout again.


Currently working:
    make life update data for RSS table ( should not be complicated )
    start adding other cryptocurrencies
future plans (I will stop mentioning long term plans as long as those plans remain same):
    add new indicators and helper functions on charts
    add analysis functions at the end of the page
    Add your own API Key. (currently using my API Key from Code. I want to change it)
    make trading possible from the platform, without going to the original site.
    make practical layout current layout works perfect for work-in-progress, but it will be needed to change for more proffesional use.

#ProjectCh 0.0.5

live update of the table was added in this version of the file. I no longer will need to restart my code in order to get updated information on my platfrom.
Addid function that allows to select cryptocurrency that will be traded. Currently I have 3 cryptocurrencies, and PAXUSDT pair (Because both pairs tring to be USD),
but adding them will not be big problem considering how code is writen:
List Of modifications in code:
    got rid of half of the code in rss.py now it should be more efficient.

Today i will start testing this app on more long term usage, and then start working on more long term goals for this project.
Curretly i see few errors and modifications in the code, that I would like to do, before confirming long usage testing.
New RSS sometimes shuts down therefore i returned to the old feed from investing.com.
Testing was as successfull as expected despide all errors in the callback function after 12h of work dash did not crash and continued working.
Now I that i have more or less stable system i will be more focused on long term possibilities.

#ProjectCh 0.1.0

Finaly basic working module is ready. This will be the project number for the ready status use.
From now on i will be working on additional features and modifing already existing ones for better usage.

#ProjectCh 0.1.1
In this version I added:
    Real Time traded Volume as second extension of the Pie Chart (Still Do not know selling amount for Takers.)
    New class that gives me historical traded values. I do not use it for graphs, but it will be easier if i will ever use it again.
I know work wise this update did not give me any big improvements, but in order to get here i had to analyse what data i recieved from
endpoint and how i was going to destribut it, also Volume.py was changed at least few times, before i settled how i wanted to recieve data.

Working for next Version:
    I will be focusing on order book data analysis. I do not think current information is enough to make edducated desicion.
    I will also be focusing on price developement analysis.



#ProjectCh 0.1.1

Ok this is stange. mostly i worked on improving already existing features of the app and ended up completly revorking buy sell information. so basicly i undid
everything from last version of the file and reworked everything from the scratch. not that i am compaining now it looks much better and user
does not need to do pointless adjustments in order to get the infromation. secondly I added history of volume for buy and sell. it in theory will give user
(Or in this case me :)) some depth to work with.

I was thinking about this app when i finished working on the final version which took me 10x more time then i would have liked and adding more graphs does not make any
kind of sence for me. for now it is easy to read and user does not have to do 1000 useless actions to get simple data. I would like to keep it as simple
as possible at least for the future. (Lets see how i will be able to do it considering how much data i would like to add to the app.)

Therefore I think i will continue working on simplification of the data. so i will stop adding new graphs for now and focus on better chart types/quality for already
existing features.

#ProjectCT 0.1.2
First change that i made in the code is BOLL calculation for small amounts. turns out i had little bit mistake with regards to small numbers. now it will be working,
But not with too small amounts.
I also changed PAX to XRP. i do not think having pax here will change anything. XRP should be more usufull.
Currntly platform is tested on: BTCUSDT, ETHUSDT, XRPUSDT, BNBUSDT.
