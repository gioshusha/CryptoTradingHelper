# projectCH
This project will help visualise data and performe analysis on current data.
currently working:
    make simple line chart which will show prices from CSV file.
    add some code that will download data from csv
# projectCH 0.0.1
In this version i decided to start making more specialised version of my app.
original goal was to create little infromative app using dash.plot.ly, but i think i will be able to create something
more interesting that orignially planned.

Currently working:

add pie chart showing supply and demand
make above mentioned pie chart update in real time (currently they)
make sure that line chart will take data directly from code ignoring CSV file.
change price download file

# ProjectCh 0.0.2
In this version I added live updates on pie chart, that shows current supply and demand ratio from market.
RSS feed from investing.com ( need to change it, we only have excess to topics.)
There also is new version of line chart that displays BOLL incicator and prices in last 24h.

Currently working:

live update on RSS \n
live update of the lates price in text format.

future plans (most likely will not be added in next version of the file):

add option to chose between cryptocurrencies.
find better RSS feed which will give me more information that current one.
Add your own API Key. (currently using my API Key from Code. I want to change it)
make trading possible from the platform, without going to the original site.
# ProjectCh 0.0.3
In this version i updated both RSS links, but most importand is that i was able to addit real time text. currently with
this method i am traking price and supply and demand weighted average prices.
had to change max number of RSS Mannually in rss.py. did not understand reason for the error, because max number of rss was same for both links,
but for some reason it did not give me error with old code

Currently working:

modifing visualisation of existing graphs and page as a whole.

Future plans did not change from last time except I would like to add analysis in the platform.
Main priority is to make sure, that i will not need to resart code in order to see updates.

# ProjectCh 0.0.4
Ok this update was faster than I expected. Main changes were mostly cosmetic:
1)I made main chart Bigger. now it takes whole page rather than some parts of it.
2)Changed background color and font color for both graphs and text.
3)Color code for supply pie chart
4)changed places for few of the data holders.

(side comment)
now i am more or less setisfied for the DEMO version of my layout. of course it will be much more complicated and more infromative in the future (I hope)
but for now it is as good as it will get. I prefer to work for future modifications of the file making it more usufull before i start to modify layout again.


Currently working:

make life update data for RSS table ( should not be complicated )
start adding other cryptocurrencies

future plans (I will stop mentioning long term plans as long as those plans remain same):

add new indicators and helper functions on charts
add analysis functions at the end of the page
Add your own API Key. (currently using my API Key from Code. I want to change it)
make trading possible from the platform, without going to the original site.
make practical layout current layout works perfect for work-in-progress, but it will be needed to change for external use.
# ProjectCh 0.0.5
life update of the table was added in this version of the file. I no longer will need to restart my code in order to get updated information on my platfrom.
WORK-IN-PROGRESS
